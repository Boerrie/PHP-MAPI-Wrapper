About
=====

This project provides a starting point for integrating the Brightcove Media
API into your application. It provides simple ways to interact with the
API, as well as a long list of helper functions.

Compatibility Notice
====================

Please note that the PHP MAPI Wrapper v2.0 is **not** compatible with any
previous versions (when it was known as "Echove"). The class name has been
changed, numerous functions have been re-named, and methods have been
updated to take advantage of Brightcove API changes.

If you need assistance in determining what changes have been made, please
send an e-mail to opensource@brightcove.com with your request.

Requirements
============

PHP version 5.2 or greater, or you must have the JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON) PECL package. For more information on the JSON PECL package, please visit the
[PHP JSON](http://www.php.net/json) package website.
